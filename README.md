# ThudStick
Fightstick with fully analog joystick functions as a gamecube controller utilizing a PHOB v2.02 motherboard, a c-pad daughterboard, and a custom designed PCB to host the hall effect sensors to fit a Sanwa-JLF joystick. 
### Features
- Full analog joystick
- Digital face buttons (A,B,X,Y,Z)
- Digital C-Stick
- Digital hard shield and light shield buttons
- Powered by a PHOB v2.02 motherboard
- Utilizes a C-Pad (https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/c-pad/tree/main)
- Housing and PCB for the Sanwa Joystick adapted from the Sharp Analog Snap-In (https://github.com/Sharp-02/JLF-Sharp-Analog-Snap-In/tree/main) to connect the hall effect sensors directly to the PHOB motherboard rather than using a PCB that requires the additional soldering and calibrations of resistors, op-amps, and trimpots to be compatible with an OEM board
- Custom layout files for laser cut acrylic face plates
